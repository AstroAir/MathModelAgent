Two paragraphs
Approximately 250 words

Reference template:
This question requires solving the optimal planting plan for 2024-2030 based on sales volume, planting cost, yield per acre, sales price and other relevant data, considering constraints such as land resources and planting conditions. Problem 1 is divided into two sub-questions, and the profit-optimal planting plan is solved under two different unsalable processing methods, i.e., two different single objective functions.
Assuming that the 2023 crop data (sales volume, price, yield per acre, planting cost) remain unchanged, and without considering environmental volatility, a single-objective planning model can be established for solving. The Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm model is used to solve the optimal crop planting method, compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the planning results of the model are evaluated. The Harris Hawk Optimization algorithm has stronger local search capability and parallel processing capability, is more flexible and agile in problem solving, can search and summarize data more quickly, and finally selects the Harris Hawk algorithm model (HHO) for solving.
